# FitnessGym Mockup Website

Welcome to my **FitnessGym mockup website**! This project is a showcase of my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. It is a simple, responsive website designed to represent a fitness gym, complete with a modern layout and interactive elements.

## Project Description

The FitnessGym mockup website is a design concept that I created to improve my CSS skills while imagining a fitness gym. This mockup represents how I envision a modern fitness gym's online presence. The website is designed with a clean, user-friendly interface, and aims to provide an example of a fitness gym's promotional site.

### Key Features:
- **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to work across a variety of devices, from desktops to smartphones, using **Bootstrap**'s responsive grid system.
- **Custom Styling**: I applied **CSS** to create a professional, clean look, using custom fonts, colors, and layout styles to enhance the user experience.
- **Dropdown Animation**: I used **JavaScript** to implement a smooth window dropdown animation, enhancing interactivity and user engagement.

### Why I Created This Mockup:
I created this mockup primarily to:
- Improve my **CSS** skills and learn more about building responsive, modern websites.
- Bring to life the vision of a fitness gym's website, drawing inspiration from gyms I admire.
- Experiment with **JavaScript** for animations and to make the website feel more interactive.

## Technologies Used:
- **HTML**: The structure of the website is created using HTML5.
- **CSS**: Custom CSS was used for styling, with a focus on layout and responsiveness.
- **Bootstrap**: The site utilizes the Bootstrap framework for a responsive layout and grid system.
- **JavaScript**: Basic JavaScript for dropdown animations and interactivity.
